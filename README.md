### Hello 👋

I'm Jef, a French web developper planning to move to Canada.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning three.js, Kotlin, data structures and algorithms and design patterns.
- ❤️ I love every aspect of web development: front-end, back-end, devops, you name it!
- :hankey: I don't like PHP but can use it if i'm forced to.
- :muscle: Health is important so I regularly work out.
